Project Overview

The Quiz App project is developed as part of the Distributed Applications course, aiming to create a distributed quiz application with various functionalities. The project is a collaborative effort by students to design and implement a system that allows users to create, manage, and participate in quizzes on different topics.
Key Features

    Creation and management of questions: Users can create new questions and retrieve existing questions based on their IDs.
    Organization of quizzes: The application supports the creation of question sets and quizzes, allowing users to associate participants with specific sets of questions.
    Interactive participation: Participants can register for quizzes, answer questions, and advance through quiz rounds.
    Reporting: The system generates reports with quiz results, providing insights into participant performance.

Technologies Used

The project utilizes Python for backend development, with Flask framework for building the server-side application. SQLite3 is used as the database management system for storing quiz-related data. Integration with Apache ZooKeeper is implemented for event monitoring and coordination. SSL/TLS protocol ensures secure communication between the client and server.
Future Development

Future enhancements to the project may include additional features such as user authentication, improved UI/UX, support for multimedia questions, and scalability for handling a larger number of concurrent users.

Overall, the Quiz App project showcases the application of distributed systems concepts in real-world scenarios, providing a practical learning experience for students in the field of distributed applications development.
